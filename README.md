Haze
====
Haze霾 is a wearable air quality detector, which is a strong appeal for people to pay attention to issues of air pollution, a very serious issue facing China today.

The Beijing government issued the first orange alert January 13, 2013. At that time, Beijing had had many days with heavy pollution weather. “Levels of PM2.5 particles are above 200 micrograms per cubic meter in most urban areas of the capital, that’s way above safety levels. Many areas have a level 5 "heavy pollution" warning, with some places at level 6, the highest pollution level,” state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Air pollution has become a severe crisis in China.

Haze霾 encourages people to rethink the air pollution crises through a visual performance, as an actor wears the device to detect the air quality around the city, turning the air quality itself into the key communication with which to engage people in critical discussion.
