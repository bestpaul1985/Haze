Haze
====
Haze霾 is a wearable air quality detector, which is a strong appeal for people to pay attention to issues of air pollution, a very serious issue facing China today.

The Beijing government issued the first orange alert January 13, 2013. At that time, Beijing had had many days with heavy pollution weather. “Levels of PM2.5 particles are above 200 micrograms per cubic meter in most urban areas of the capital, that’s way above safety levels. Many areas have a level 5 "heavy pollution" warning, with some places at level 6, the highest pollution level,” state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Air pollution has become a severe crisis in China.

Haze霾 encourages people to rethink the air pollution crises through a visual performance, as an actor wears the device to detect the air quality around the city, turning the air quality itself into the key communication with which to engage people in critical discussion.

This project was made during School for [Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io/), and presented in SFPC:[The First Class](http://sfpc.io/thefirstclass/) at [Eyebeam Art and Technology Center](http://www.eyebeam.org/events/school-for-poetic-computation-the-first-class)

##Optical Dust Sensor

Sharp's GP2Y1010AU0F is an optical air quality sensor, designed to sense dust particles. An infrared emitting diode and a phototransistor are diagonally arranged into this device, to allow it to detect the reflected light of dust in air. It is especially effective in detecting very fine particles like cigarette smoke, and is commonly used in air purifier systems.

The sensor has a very low current consumption (20mA max, 11mA typical), and can be powered with up to 7VDC. The output of the sensor is an analog voltage proportional to the measured dust density, with a sensitivity of 0.5V/0.1mg/m3.

[Trinket](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1500) may be small, but do not be fooled by its size! It's a tiny microcontroller board, built around the Atmel ATtiny85, a little chip with a lot of power. We wanted to design a microcontroller board that was small enough to fit into any project, and low cost enough to use without hesitation. Perfect for when you don't want to give up your expensive dev-board and you aren't willing to take apart the project you worked so hard to design. It's our lowest-cost arduino-IDE programmable board!
